## Command line tool

If `mondo-bank` was installed with the global `-g` flag, the command `mondo` will be available.

Otherwise, ensure that `bin/mondo-cli.js` is in your path.


### CLI usage

Please refer to the built-in documentation

    mondo --help


### CLI config files

By default, the `mondo` cli tool looks for the config files it needs to run in the current working directory.

To override this, pass the config argument

The config files located in the config directory are:

- `credentials.json`
  stores your developer and user details (generated if not found)
- `tokens.json`
  stores your app tokens
- `defaults.json`
  provides default values for method args
